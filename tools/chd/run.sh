# Writes a synthetic two-track image (tools/chd/make_fixture.py), compresses
# it with each CD codec family chdman offers -- zstd (cdzs), LZMA (cdlz),
# zlib (cdzl), FLAC (cdfl) -- and as a parent/child pair, then checks every
# frame of each CHD against the BIN it came from with chd_image_test, built
# under AddressSanitizer + UBSan with leak detection. Each image is read
# twice: through the file, and with image_memcache.
#
# The preprocessor flags are read back out of the core's own build, so the
# test decodes with exactly the codec set the core is built with.
#
# Needs chdman (MAME tools) and python3. Fails rather than skips when either
# is missing: a CHD check that quietly does nothing is how a codec stops
# working without anyone noticing.
